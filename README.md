# CODE_investment_cost_calculation_heating_systems.py 
This code calculates the investment costs of heating systems, which consist of equipment costs, contribution margin, and installation costs.
The investment costs of the heating systems are used as input for the calculation of the levelized cost of heating. Note: In this version of the code we assume a cop of 3 for air-water and water-water heat pumps. In the paper, we used a cop depending on the supply temperature and the heat pump type.

# DATA_equipment_cost.xlsx
This document contains data on heating equipment costs taken from 2023 price lists of the German manufacturers Buderus, Elco, Vaillant, and Viessmann. For reasons of confidentiality, the article and manufacturer names of individual equipment are not visible. All prices are in Euro 2023. Equipment costs of heat pumps and boilers include necessary control devices. Equipment costs of air-to-air heat pumps include inside units. For larger air-to-air heat pumps, multiple inside units are included.

# DATA_installation_cost
This document contains data on heating installation costs taken from real offers of the five installation firms E. Altmann GmbH, KÃ¶nig GmbH & Co. KG, Moritz & Bramer GmbH, Octopus Energy, and Thermondo in Germany. For reasons of confidentiality, it is not visible which data point corresponds to which company. All prices are in Euro 2023.
